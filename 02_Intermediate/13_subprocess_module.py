# This tutorial is best followed in a shell / command prompt.
# Open yours up, type python, or python3, and then follow.
import subprocess

# module  call command in the shell
# you can change that if you'd like, eventually.
# IF YOU ARE NOT IN A SHELL, YOU WILL SEE NO OUTPUT!
subprocess.call('dir', shell=True)
subprocess.call('echo dir', shell=True)
